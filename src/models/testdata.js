      line character (not a \n obviously). The reason \n exists is to allow developers an easy way to put the  \
      newline character (ASCII: 10) into their strings. \
      When you have a string which looks like this \
      //Note lack of terminating double quote \
      var foo = "Bob  \
      Your code will have a syntax error at that point and cease to run. \
      If you wish to have a string which spans multiple lines, you may insert a backslash characjust be \
      fore you terminate the line, like so: \
      //Perfectly valid code \
      var foo = "Bob \ \
      is \ \
      cool."; \
      However that string will not contain \n characters in the positions where the string was broken into separa \
      te lines. The only way to insert a newline into a string is to insert a character with a value of 10, the e \
      asiest way of which is the \n escape character \
